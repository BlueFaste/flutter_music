# music

A new Flutter project based on the [video of Driss AS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8_kXpMeps&t=36s).

#Informations

This project is my first flutter project.
I followed Driss As' video from beginning to end : [Tuto Flutter DÃ©butant: Comment CrÃ©er Le Design D'une Application De Musique Avec Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8_kXpMeps&t=36s).
This application is 2 page of a music player. One is the music's list and second is a management of music player;
I develop with only stateless widget.
I hope you will like my first application.
Enjoy ðŸ˜‡
